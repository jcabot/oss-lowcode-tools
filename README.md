# List of open source low-code tools

Based on a search in GitHub

## Selection method
The selection method is based on the following initial criteria:

- Repositories that declare themselves as low-code projects stars ≥ 50
- Repositories with stars ≥ 50
- Repositories with last commit at least 1 year ago
- Repositories with information in English

The final list is the intersection of the above criteria manually curated to remove projects that use low-code in a different sense of what we mean by low-code in software develpoment. For more information about low-code, see:
